What happens if someone uses stochastic gradient descent with batch size **one** in a simple linear regression problem? Does the estimator converge to the OLS estimator which uses the full data?

#### Concentration of measures: A simple observation
"It is of course impossible to even think the word Gaussian without immediately mentioning the most important property of  Gaussian processes, that is concentration of measure."  M. Talagrand

#### Symmetry: Dimensionality reduction and generalization (Working on it)

Symmetry as an a priori information can lead to extensive dimensionality reduction (alleviation of curse of dimensionality) and extreme generalization power. I provide two examples: rotation and permutation invariance
